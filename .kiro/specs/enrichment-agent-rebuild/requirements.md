# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves completely rebuilding the enrichment agent to create a sophisticated prospect research system. The new enrichment agent will receive prospect data from the master planner, conduct deep research using the Sonar API, employ AI thinking methods with Gemini for analysis, and build comprehensive context profiles. The agent will update the frontend in real-time and pass enriched data to the outreach agent for personalized engagement.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a sales team member, I want the enrichment agent to automatically receive prospect data from the workflow orchestrator, so that research begins immediately after prospect discovery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the orchestrator sends prospect data to the enrichment agent THEN the agent SHALL receive and validate the data structure
2. WHEN prospect data is received THEN the agent SHALL log the receipt and initiate the enrichment workflow
3. WHEN invalid or incomplete prospect data is received THEN the agent SHALL return appropriate error messages and request data correction
4. WHEN the agent is busy with another enrichment THEN it SHALL queue new requests and process them in priority order

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a sales team member, I want the enrichment agent to use mock data for testing and development, so that we can validate the research process without relying on live prospect data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is in development mode THEN the agent SHALL use predefined mock prospect data for testing
2. WHEN mock data is used THEN the agent SHALL conduct real research on the mock prospects to validate functionality
3. WHEN mock data research is complete THEN the results SHALL be clearly marked as test data
4. WHEN switching between mock and live data THEN the agent SHALL maintain the same processing workflow

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a sales team member, I want the enrichment agent to conduct comprehensive research using the Sonar API, so that we have detailed information about prospects and their organizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prospect data is received THEN the agent SHALL construct targeted search queries for the Sonar API
2. WHEN conducting research THEN the agent SHALL search for personal information, company details, recent activities, and event planning history
3. WHEN Sonar API calls are made THEN the agent SHALL implement proper rate limiting and error handling
4. WHEN research data is gathered THEN the agent SHALL validate and structure the information for analysis
5. WHEN API limits are reached THEN the agent SHALL queue requests and retry with exponential backoff

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a sales team member, I want the enrichment agent to use Gemini AI with reasoning methods to intelligently analyze research data, so that we can extract meaningful insights and see the AI's decision-making process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN research data is collected THEN the agent SHALL create a reasoning plan and send it to Gemini for systematic analysis
2. WHEN using Gemini THEN the agent SHALL employ step-by-step AI thinking methods and broadcast each reasoning step to the frontend
3. WHEN analyzing data THEN the agent SHALL show its reasoning process (e.g., "Analyzing LinkedIn profile... Found event planning experience... Confidence: High")
4. WHEN making decisions THEN the agent SHALL explain its logic and broadcast the reasoning to the frontend in real-time
5. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the agent SHALL extract key insights with explanations of how it reached each conclusion
6. WHEN Gemini analysis fails THEN the agent SHALL log the failure and halt the enrichment process with a clear error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a sales team member, I want the enrichment agent to build comprehensive prospect profiles, so that we have complete context for personalized outreach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the agent SHALL compile a comprehensive prospect profile with all gathered information
2. WHEN building profiles THEN the agent SHALL include personal details, company information, event preferences, budget analysis, and engagement history
3. WHEN profiles are created THEN the agent SHALL assign confidence scores to each data point
4. WHEN insufficient data is available THEN the agent SHALL identify gaps and suggest additional research sources
5. WHEN profiles are complete THEN the agent SHALL validate data consistency and flag any anomalies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a sales team member, I want the enrichment agent to display its reasoning process and search activities in real-time, so that I can understand how the AI is thinking and what research it's conducting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN enrichment begins THEN the agent SHALL create a reasoning plan and broadcast it to the frontend via WebSocket
2. WHEN making research decisions THEN the agent SHALL send AI thinking updates showing its reasoning process (similar to the AIThoughtProcess component)
3. WHEN conducting searches THEN the agent SHALL display what it's searching for in a dashboard format (e.g., "Searching LinkedIn for John Smith...", "Analyzing company website...")
4. WHEN analyzing data THEN the agent SHALL show its analytical reasoning and decision-making process in real-time
5. WHEN completing research steps THEN the agent SHALL update the frontend with progress indicators and next planned actions
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the agent SHALL explain its reasoning for error handling and recovery strategies

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a sales team member, I want the enriched data to be automatically passed to the outreach agent, so that personalized engagement can begin immediately after research completion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN enrichment is successfully completed THEN the agent SHALL format the data for the outreach agent
2. WHEN passing data to outreach THEN the agent SHALL include all relevant insights, preferences, and personalization opportunities
3. WHEN data transfer occurs THEN the agent SHALL log the handoff and confirm receipt by the outreach agent
4. WHEN the outreach agent is unavailable THEN the enrichment agent SHALL queue the data and retry delivery
5. WHEN data transfer fails THEN the agent SHALL alert the system administrators and store the data for manual processing

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the enrichment agent to have comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can monitor performance and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation fails THEN the agent SHALL log detailed error information with context and stack traces
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the agent SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns
3. WHEN system resources are low THEN the agent SHALL throttle operations and prioritize critical tasks
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the agent SHALL halt processing and alert administrators with detailed error information
5. WHEN Gemini or Sonar API failures occur THEN the agent SHALL stop the enrichment process and report the specific failure

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a sales team member, I want the enrichment agent to maintain data privacy and security, so that prospect information is protected according to compliance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling prospect data THEN the agent SHALL encrypt sensitive information in transit and at rest
2. WHEN storing research data THEN the agent SHALL implement data retention policies and automatic cleanup
3. WHEN accessing external APIs THEN the agent SHALL use secure authentication and validate SSL certificates
4. WHEN logging information THEN the agent SHALL redact personally identifiable information from log files
5. WHEN data is no longer needed THEN the agent SHALL securely delete it according to privacy regulations
