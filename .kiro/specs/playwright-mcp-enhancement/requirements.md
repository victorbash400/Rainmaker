# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for enhancing the Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to provide intelligent web navigation using DOM analysis and Gemini AI. The enhanced MCP will extract page structure as text, use AI to understand what actions to take, and execute prospect hunting tasks across multiple websites. This builds on the existing working browser foundation while adding AI-powered decision making for dynamic navigation and data extraction.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a prospect hunter agent, I want the MCP to extract page structure as text and use AI to understand what actions to take, so that navigation decisions are fast and reliable without screenshots.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating to any page THEN the system SHALL extract all interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) with text, attributes, and context
2. WHEN page loads THEN the system SHALL provide AI with structured JSON of page elements and current task goal
3. WHEN AI analyzes page structure THEN the system SHALL receive specific element IDs and actions to execute
4. WHEN actions complete THEN the system SHALL re-extract page state and continue until task is done
5. WHEN task goals are achieved THEN the system SHALL return structured prospect data
6. WHEN unexpected page states occur THEN the system SHALL use AI to analyze DOM changes and adapt approach

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a prospect hunter agent, I want the MCP to understand and fill forms intelligently using AI analysis of form structure, so that I can search for prospects on any website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering search forms THEN the system SHALL use AI to identify search inputs by analyzing labels, placeholders, and context
2. WHEN filling forms THEN the system SHALL use AI to determine appropriate values based on task goals (e.g., "wedding planners Switzerland")
3. WHEN multiple form options exist THEN the system SHALL use AI to choose the most relevant fields for prospect hunting
4. WHEN form submission is needed THEN the system SHALL use AI to identify and click the correct submit button
5. WHEN form validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL use AI to understand error messages and correct inputs
6. WHEN advanced search options are available THEN the system SHALL use AI to determine which filters to apply

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a prospect hunter agent, I want the MCP to search multiple sites intelligently for prospects, so that I can gather leads from Google, LinkedIn, Eventbrite, and other relevant platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN given a search task THEN the system SHALL navigate to specified sites (Google, LinkedIn, Eventbrite, etc.)
2. WHEN on each site THEN the system SHALL use AI to analyze page structure and find search functionality
3. WHEN search results appear THEN the system SHALL use AI to extract relevant prospect information (names, companies, contact info)
4. WHEN pagination exists THEN the system SHALL use AI to identify "next page" links and continue extraction
5. WHEN multiple sites are searched THEN the system SHALL aggregate and deduplicate prospect data
6. WHEN task completes THEN the system SHALL return structured prospect data from all sites with source attribution

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a prospect hunter agent, I want the MCP to adapt to different website layouts using AI, so that navigation works on sites I haven't pre-programmed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering unknown site layouts THEN the system SHALL use AI to analyze DOM structure and understand page purpose
2. WHEN looking for specific functionality THEN the system SHALL use AI to identify likely elements based on text content and attributes
3. WHEN normal navigation paths fail THEN the system SHALL use AI to suggest alternative approaches (different selectors, navigation paths)
4. WHEN sites change layouts THEN the system SHALL adapt without requiring code updates
5. WHEN multiple navigation options exist THEN the system SHALL use AI to choose the most efficient path
6. WHEN site-specific quirks are encountered THEN the system SHALL use AI to understand and work around them

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As any Rainmaker agent, I want to give the MCP natural language tasks and get structured results, so that I can automate prospect hunting workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving tasks like "find wedding planners in Switzerland" THEN the system SHALL break down into site-specific search steps
2. WHEN executing tasks THEN the system SHALL maintain context about what information to collect
3. WHEN encountering decision points THEN the system SHALL use AI to choose actions that best serve the task goal
4. WHEN tasks complete THEN the system SHALL return structured JSON with extracted prospect data and confidence scores
5. WHEN multiple task types are requested THEN the system SHALL adapt approach based on task requirements (B2B vs B2C prospects)
6. WHEN task parameters change THEN the system SHALL adjust search strategies and data collection accordingly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the MCP to handle common web automation failures intelligently, so that prospect hunting continues even when sites have issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN elements aren't found THEN the system SHALL use AI to suggest alternative selectors or approaches
2. WHEN pages load slowly THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent waiting strategies based on page state
3. WHEN encountering errors THEN the system SHALL use AI to analyze error context and suggest recovery actions
4. WHEN sites are temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL skip and continue with other sites
5. WHEN rate limiting occurs THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate delays and retry logic
6. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL pause and request human assistance with clear context

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system developer, I want the enhanced MCP to maintain compatibility with existing agents while providing new AI capabilities, so that current workflows continue to function.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing agents call current MCP tools THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing interfaces
2. WHEN new AI-powered tools are called THEN the system SHALL return structured results in the expected format
3. WHEN multiple agents use the MCP concurrently THEN the system SHALL handle parallel browser sessions safely
4. WHEN browser resources are no longer needed THEN the system SHALL clean up automatically
5. WHEN the system restarts THEN the system SHALL restore any necessary session state
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return error responses in the expected format for agent handling

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a prospect hunter agent, I want the MCP to provide visual feedback during automation, so that I can monitor progress and understand what the AI is doing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI is analyzing pages THEN the system SHALL capture screenshots for the browser viewer with step descriptions
2. WHEN actions are being executed THEN the system SHALL provide visual updates showing current page state
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide visual context showing what the AI encountered
4. WHEN tasks are progressing THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step updates with AI decision explanations
5. WHEN human intervention is needed THEN the system SHALL clearly show the current state and required assistance
6. WHEN tasks complete THEN the system SHALL provide a visual summary of actions taken and results achieved

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the MCP to use AI for intelligent content analysis and extraction, so that I can get meaningful insights from prospect data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is extracted from websites THEN the system SHALL use AI to analyze and categorize prospect information
2. WHEN prospect data is found THEN the system SHALL use AI to assess quality and relevance to event planning
3. WHEN multiple data points are available THEN the system SHALL use AI to synthesize and prioritize valuable information
4. WHEN context is important THEN the system SHALL use AI to understand relationships between different pieces of information
5. WHEN data quality varies THEN the system SHALL use AI to assess confidence levels and data completeness
6. WHEN results are returned THEN the system SHALL include AI-generated summaries and insights about extracted data

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the MCP to provide comprehensive logging and monitoring of AI decisions, so that I can troubleshoot issues and optimize performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria
