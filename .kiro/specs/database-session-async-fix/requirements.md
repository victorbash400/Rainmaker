# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Rainmaker backend application is experiencing a critical error where the database MCP (Model Context Protocol) server is attempting to use `AsyncSessionLocal` for asynchronous database operations, but the current database session configuration in `app/db/session.py` only provides synchronous sessions (`SessionLocal`). This mismatch is causing runtime errors when the campaign planning functionality tries to store campaign plans in the database.

The error manifests as: `name 'AsyncSessionLocal' is not defined` when executing database operations through the MCP layer.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database session configuration to support both synchronous and asynchronous operations, so that all parts of the application can access the database without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN both `SessionLocal` (sync) and `AsyncSessionLocal` (async) SHALL be available for import
2. WHEN async database operations are performed THEN they SHALL use the async session factory without errors
3. WHEN sync database operations are performed THEN they SHALL continue to work with the existing sync session factory
4. WHEN the database connection is configured THEN it SHALL support both sync and async operations with proper connection pooling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database MCP server to properly import and use async sessions, so that database operations through the MCP layer work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database MCP server is initialized THEN it SHALL import `AsyncSessionLocal` successfully
2. WHEN async database operations are executed through MCP tools THEN they SHALL complete without import errors
3. WHEN the MCP server performs database health checks THEN they SHALL use async sessions properly
4. WHEN multiple async database operations are performed concurrently THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the campaign planning feature, I want campaign plans to be stored in the database successfully, so that I can retrieve and execute them later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a campaign plan is created through the planning conversation THEN it SHALL be stored in the database without errors
2. WHEN campaign plan storage fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and not crash
3. WHEN retrieving stored campaign plans THEN they SHALL be accessible through both sync and async database operations
4. WHEN the application handles database operations THEN it SHALL maintain data consistency across sync and async operations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database configuration to be optimized for TiDB Serverless, so that the application performs well in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to TiDB Serverless THEN the async session SHALL use appropriate connection pooling settings
2. WHEN database connections are idle THEN they SHALL be properly recycled according to TiDB Serverless best practices
3. WHEN SSL connections are required THEN both sync and async sessions SHALL use the same SSL configuration
4. WHEN connection errors occur THEN both sync and async sessions SHALL handle them gracefully with proper retry logic
