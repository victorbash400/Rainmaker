**🎉 Turn Event Planners into Rainmakers**

*Automatically find people planning events and convert them into paying clients*

## 🎯 What is Rainmaker?

**Rainmaker helps event planning companies automatically find and convert prospects into clients.**

If you run a wedding planning business, corporate event company, or party planning service, Rainmaker finds people who are actively planning events and turns them into your customers through AI automation.

### The Problem
- Event planners waste hours manually searching for prospects
- Most outreach is generic and gets ignored
- You miss hot prospects because you can't monitor everywhere
- Converting prospects to clients requires constant manual follow-up

### The Solution
**6 AI agents work together to automate your entire sales process:**

```mermaid

    A[🕵️ Hunter<br/>Finds prospects planning events] --> B[🧠 Enrichment<br/>Researches their needs deeply]
    B --> C[📧 Outreach<br/>Sends personalized messages]
    C --> D[💬 Conversation<br/>Handles their responses]
    D --> E[📋 Proposal<br/>Creates custom proposals]
    E --> F[📅 Meeting<br/>Schedules consultations]
    F --> G[💰 Client]
    
    style A fill:#e3f2fd

## 🤖 How Each AI Agent Works

### 🕵️ **Hunter Agent** - AI-Powered Web Prospecting

**Uses Playwright + AI reasoning to find prospects across the web**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[🎯 Target: Find people planning events] --> B[🌐 Playwright Browser Automation]
    B --> C[🔍 LinkedIn Search]
    B --> D[📱 Social Media Scanning]
    B --> E[🏢 Company Website Monitoring]
    
    C --> F[🤖 AI Reasoning Engine]
    D --> F
    E --> F
    
    F --> G{🧠 Is this person planning an event?}
    G -->|Yes| H[💾 Store in TiDB]
    G -->|No| I[❌ Skip]
    G -->|Maybe| J[🔄 Gather more data]
    
    H --> K[📊 Prospect Profile Created]
    J --> F
    
    style F fill:#e3f2fd
    style H fill:#e8f5e8
```

**How it works:**
1. **AI Navigation:** Uses Gemini AI to read web pages and decide what to click
2. **Smart Searching:** Searches LinkedIn for "wedding planning", "event coordinator", "getting married"
3. **Pattern Recognition:** AI identifies event planning signals in posts and profiles
4. **Data Extraction:** Pulls names, companies, event types, timelines
5. **Quality Scoring:** Rates prospect quality based on event signals

**Example Hunt:** Finds "Sarah Johnson - Just got engaged! Looking for wedding venues in Austin for Fall 2024"

### 🧠 **Enrichment Agent** - Deep Research with TiDB Vector Intelligence

**The most sophisticated agent - uses TiDB vector search for intelligent prospect analysis**

    G --> M
    
    style H fill:#f3e5f5
    style E fill:#fff3e0
    style J fill:#e8f5e8
```

**The TiDB Vector Process:**

| Step | What Happens | TiDB Operation |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **1. Research** | Searches web for "Sarah Johnson Austin wedding" | `INSERT INTO research_data` |
| **2. Vectorize** | Converts text to 3072-dimensional embedding | `content_vector VECTOR(3072)` |
| **3. Store** | Saves vector in TiDB with metadata | `INSERT INTO prospect_scraped_data` |
| **4. Search** | Finds similar prospects using cosine similarity | `VEC_COSINE_DISTANCE(content_vector, query_vector)` |
| **5. Analyze** | AI finds patterns across similar prospects | `ORDER BY similarity DESC LIMIT 10` |

**Real Vector Search Query:**
```sql
-- Find prospects similar to Sarah's profile
SELECT 
    content,
    source_title,
    (1 - VEC_COSINE_DISTANCE(content_vector, :sarah_vector)) as similarity
FROM prospect_scraped_data 
WHERE similarity > 0.8
ORDER BY similarity DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**AI Insights Generated:**
- "Similar tech professionals typically budget $18-25k for weddings"
- "Austin brides like Sarah prefer modern venues over traditional"
- "Fall weddings book 8-12 months in advance in this market"
- "Her company offers wedding planning benefits - mention this!"

```

### 🧮 Vector Search in Action

**The `prospect_scraped_data` table is where the magic happens:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE prospect_scraped_data (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    prospect_id INT,
    content LONGTEXT,                    -- Raw research data
    content_vector VECTOR(3072),         -- 3072-dimensional embedding
    source_title VARCHAR(500),
    workflow_id VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    
    -- Vector index for lightning-fast similarity search
    VECTOR INDEX idx_content_vector ((VEC_COSINE_DISTANCE(content_vector)))
);
```

### 🔍 Smart Prospect Analysis Queries

**1. Find Similar Prospects:**
```sql
-- When enriching Sarah, find prospects with similar profiles
SELECT 
    p.name,
    psd.content,
    (1 - VEC_COSINE_DISTANCE(psd.content_vector, :sarah_vector)) as similarity
FROM prospect_scraped_data psd
JOIN prospects p ON p.id = psd.prospect_id
WHERE similarity > 0.85
ORDER BY similarity DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**2. Budget Prediction:**
```sql
-- Find prospects who mentioned budget and are similar to current prospect
SELECT 
    AVG(CAST(REGEXP_SUBSTR(content, '\\$[0-9,]+') AS DECIMAL)) as avg_budget
FROM prospect_scraped_data
WHERE VEC_COSINE_DISTANCE(content_vector, :prospect_vector) < 0.2
  AND content LIKE '%budget%' OR content LIKE '%$%';
```

**3. Venue Preferences:**
```sql
-- Find venue preferences from similar prospects
SELECT 
    content,
    COUNT(*) as mentions
FROM prospect_scraped_data
WHERE VEC_COSINE_DISTANCE(content_vector, :prospect_vector) < 0.3
  AND (content LIKE '%venue%' OR content LIKE '%location%')
GROUP BY content
ORDER BY mentions DESC;
```

### 📊 Real-World Intelligence Examples

| Query Type | Vector Search Result | Business Impact |
|------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Budget Prediction** | "Similar tech brides spend $18-25k" | Price proposals accurately |
| **Timeline Analysis** | "Austin fall weddings book 8 months ahead" | Create urgency in outreach |
| **Venue Preferences** | "Modern venues preferred by 78% of similar prospects" | Recommend right venues |
| **Communication Style** | "Tech professionals respond better to data-driven messages" | Optimize message tone |
| **Success Probability** | "Prospects like Sarah have 85% booking rate" | Prioritize high-value leads |
